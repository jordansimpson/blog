So the new site has been deployed and with so many blogging platforms available these days it's pretty hard to decide which one is best for your needs and with one of the main things that I have been looking for is simplicity.

Having searched around reading specs and requirements for each of the possible solutions, and speaking to a few friends who also blog, I found myself upon the decision to go with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

Jekyll is by far the best solution to my current needs and it is a pleasure to build with. The platform is based on a flat file system that utilises Liquid and Markdown. Liquid was developed by Shopify and enables the site to have dynamic aspects and keep things ticking while all blog posts are written with the use of Markdown. The main benefit of the site is that no database is required so things get a lot simpler with the use of GitHub pages.

If your site is developed using Jekyll you are able to deploy it to you Github repo, on the gh-pages branch, and Github will host your site for you, like this site.

Over the course of time I will be adding more to my blog on the subject of Jekyll and hope to make improvements where neccessary.
