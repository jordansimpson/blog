Let's be honest the worst thing in a designers eyes is something that hasn’t turned out the way they'd like it to visually but talking from experience I think it's safer to say that the feeling of failing to finish a project on time is worse.

The term perfectionist it floated about on occasion when there's that one designer who can't let something go when it comes to their design and won't move on until it's to the standard that they want it to be. The truth is though that there is no such thing as perfection and I know because I used to be **that guy**.

Perfection is a matter of opinion and no matter how hard a perfectionist tries to scratch that itch it's not necessarily going to achieve anything better than what they originally had. Now don't get this confused with having pride in your work and producing something to the best of your ability, it's far from it. This is for those who hold the rest of the project up with their 'perfectionism'.

What a good designer should be aware of is when it's not going to be 100% the way they wanted it this time around but has the awareness to know where improvements could be made and make them on the next project. When it comes to your skills the old cliché of 'Rome wasn’t built in a day' very much comes into play and if it didn't then a doctor would be able to get there degree based on their passion to help others and not on their drive to learning. We never stop learning so it's an endless road and if you are one of those that site back and thinks *’you can’t teach me because I'm more capable’* then I'm afraid you are no longer improving, you've settled. By settling, you will be stuck with your current skill set for the rest of your career (sad to think about really but that's your choice). 

I recently found the short video below which is about a gentleman who considers himself a perfectionist. Though it is nice to see someone take so much pride in their work I believe that the message he gets across is slightly mixed, you be the judge (note the caption at the end of the video).

Did you watch it?...

Good, that means you may have noticed what I did and that's that he is a perfectionist yet the last caption states that he has been restoring vintage Coca-Cola machines for **over 20 years**. Now I am pretty sure that in that time he has had to learn along the way and that everything he has achieved is based upon some trial and error. 

As I mentioned above, there is nothing wrong with you taking pride in your work but just be aware of the situation that you are in at the time. Do you have the time to put those smaller touches to it before you ship your current project or is it something that you can make a note of for your next project?
