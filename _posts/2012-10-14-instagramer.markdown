As a big fan of the photography app Instagram I found the short film below produced by Ira Chute around Mike Kus’s use of Instagram very interesting.

If you are an Instagram user and you aren’t aware of who Mike Kus is then I suggest you visit his Instagram [profile](http://instagram.com/mikekus) and look at his photos as they are outstanding.

As a fan of photography I have found that the use of the smartphone cameras, whether it be using an iPhone or an Android phone, has opened up a whole new world to people in regards to photo opportunities and has enabled me to capture moments in my life which I may not get the opportunity to experience again.

Through the use of Instagram, not only do your photos become of interest to you but also to other people and the photos that people you follow post gives you a caption of which way their life has taken them and the experiences that they have gained. The whole social side of it has been embraced by the masses, as those who believe that their words may not be of interest to others have found that their photos are gaining a lot of interest. I feel that the community of users that you find on Instagram is one of encouragement as you will be able to gain feedback from your followers which can help you to improve your photo taking skills.

There are a number of apps that I have found very useful with my iPhonegraphy that I have listed below (sorry android users, I’m afraid I can’t guarantee these apps will be available on Google Play). I have paid for and downloaded a lot of photography apps and wasted a lot of money in the process as most of the apps don’t provide what they claim to do or are very buggy. The 3 apps below have enabled me to produce better photos using my iPhone with features such as focusing and lighting changes and I hope that your find them of some use also. Before you decide whether to buy the apps you can see what kind of photos I have taken be having a visit to my Instagram [profile](http://instagram.com/jordan_simpson).
