Recently I took part in the Net Magazine Design Challenge (*Issue 257 : Summer 2014*) in which I was presented with a brief and asked to go away and produce a web design based on it.

##The Brief##
> We'd like you to make a site for a tea reseller. It might be a tea blender with its roots in antiquity or a company built to courier high-caffeine blends to hipsters via an app. Your company could serve a Chelsea clientele or a produce tea just right for burly builders: it's your choice.

Now as an avid reader of Net Magazine I jumped at the chance to take part in this challenge. I had decided straight away that I wanted to create a tea company that had some history behind it as I felt that it would be best fitting to the website I wanted to design.

I spent about half an hour coming up with the different ideas for the company but came to the simple solution of **Brewer Tea Company** which was founded in 1895 by the Brewer brothers. Corny concept I know but it gave me a base to start from and move forward with the mood for my design.

I decided that I wanted the website to an online store where visitors could buy various flavours of tea that the Brewer brothers had found during their time scouring the world. I also wanted the site to have a modern and simplistic feel to it as well as being made accesible on smartphone and tablet devices.

## My Thoughts

The overall result is something that I feel went well. There may have been room for further improvements and in hindsight I may have changed a few bits here or there but that's the reason we do these things, it helps us develop our skills.
