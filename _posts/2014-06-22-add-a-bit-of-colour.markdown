description: A recent side project of mine turned out to be a colourful one.

Any web designer will tell you that selecting the correct palette for a project can effect the way the project turns out e.g. McDonalds red and gold is one of the most iconic colour palettes on the planet, take a secon dto imagine if they had chosen to go with purple and green? and it turns our that a recent side project of mine turned out to be a colourful one.

After undertaking a recent project I found myself jotting down hex codes that I could possibly use and realised that over the course of my career I had gone through that process on numerous occasions and note pad after note pad had colour references in either the top corner or in the footer of the page.

I have taken the decision to document colours that I find while I am working and collating them into a single file to make accessible to myself and the web community via [colortab.co.uk](http://colortab.co.uk).

There are many websites and tools out there that I could use but to be honest I find my use of those intermittent and I find this an easier way to document the colours I use.

I have create the file using Sass as the referencing via variables makes it easier for me in my workflow and possibly for others. I will be keeping the file updated at least once a day and will be tweeting via [@color_tab](https://twitter.com/color_tab) to keep people updated should they wish to follow.

The project is currently in Beta and over time could delevope into a completely different project but my aim to to try and keep is as simple as possible.

If you have any suggestions for improvements please feel to send me a tweet.
