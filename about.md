You are currently on the site of Jordan Simpson, a frontend developer & web designer from just outside Birmingham, England.

This site is primarily a blogging platform built upon the Jekyll CMS, hosted on GitHub, in which you will be able to find my general ramblings and information about things that I find out. All type is set in Source Serif pro, provided by TypeKit, and Roboto, provided by Google Fonts.

If you'd like to chat why not get in touch sometime via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jordan_simpson) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/jordan_simpson)?
